"001","FAQ #001: Are there any referral programs for TRIB?No. TRIB is a completely open-source, community-led project. There are no special benefits available for existing TRIB holders who bring in new holders -- except the strengthening of the community & the token!"
"002","FAQ #002: What is the total supply of TRIB?  Is it capped or will it increase?The current total supply of TRIB as of this moment can be viewed at: https://tribtoken.com/.  The supply of TRIB is not capped. However, unlike many other tokens, due to TRIB's unique bonding curve and internal economics, the price of each TRIB token actually __increases__ as more TRIB are generated by people buying new TRIB from the smart contract."
"003","FAQ #003: How do I claim from the TRIB interest pool?Interest claiming is a competitive process.

You can attempt to claim interest by using the ""CLAIM"" button at the bottom of the web page at https://tribtoken.com/, or by making the appropriate raw smart contract calls directly to the TRIB smart contract."

"005","FAQ #005: Why is the price on UniSwap lower than the price on the TRIB website? Trading (purchases and sales) of TRIB done on UniSwap (or other DEXes / CEXes) are not subject to the 10% transaction fee coded into the main TRIB smart contract. It's reasonable to expect that DEX/CEX price of TRIB will tend to be about 10-12% lower on average. Arbitrage bots are likely to ensure that the DEX/CEX price stays in this band e"
